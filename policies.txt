Require European jobseekers to leave if they are unemployed after 6 months. Renegotiate the rules for free movement within the EU. Make migrants wait 4 years before claiming certain benefits or social housing.

Reduce the incentives for people to move to the UK, with the aim of lowering net immigration to below 100,000 people a year (currently 243,000).

Labour:
Establish stronger border control to reduce illegal immigration, with "proper" entry adn exit checks. Reduce low-skilled migration with "smarter targets", while ensuring university students and high-skilled workers can migrate. Increase fines for employing illegal immigrants, and outlaw employment agencies recruiting only abroad.

Lib Dems:
Reintroduce exit checks at UK borders, so the government can identify people overstaying their visa. Mandate people on unemployment benefits to take an English test, and require those who fail to attend English classes.

SNP:
Give the devolved Scottish government control over immigration to Scotland.
Use a Canadian-style "earned citizenship system" to attract high-skilled workers.

Plaid Cymru:
Opposes a choice of immigrants following a "point-based system", as it would not reflect Welsh needs. Asylum seekers should be able to work in Wales while waiting for their status decision. UK government should close "detention centres".

UKIP:
Like in Australia, choose immigrants based on a system of points, reflecting skills needed for work in the country. Apply points system to both EU and non-EU immigrants. Reduce net immigration to 50,000 people a year. Make language skill tests for residence permits harder. To allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without hearing their case, opt out of the Dublin treaty.

People who currently are in the UK legally would not be deported, were the UK to leave the EU.

Greens:
Reduce UK immigration controls over time. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety.
