Immigration

Require European jobseekers to leave if they are unemployed after 6 months. Renegotiate the rules for free movement within the EU. Make migrants wait 4 years before claiming certain benefits or social housing.

Reduce the incentives for people to move to the UK, with the aim of lowering net immigration to below 100,000 people a year (currently 243,000).
https://www.conservatives.com/Plan/CapWelfareReduceImmigration.aspx

Labour:
Establish stronger border control to reduce illegal immigration, with "proper" entry adn exit checks. Reduce low-skilled migration with "smarter targets", while ensuring university students and high-skilled workers can migrate.

SNP:
Give the devolved Scottish government control over immigration to Scotland.

http://www.partyof.wales/our-vision-for-a-better-society/?force=1

UKIP:
Like in Australia, choose immigrants based on a system of points, reflecting skills needed for work in the country. Apply points system to both EU and non-EU immigrants. Reduce net immigration to 50,000 people a year. Make language skill tests for residence permits harder. To allow the UK to return asylum seekers to other EU countries without hearing their case, opt out of the Dublin treaty.

People who currently are in the UK legally would not be deported, were the UK to leave the EU.

Greens:
Reduce UK immigration controls over time. Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety.

The NHS

Conservatives:
Chancellor George Osborne says he will put an extra £2bn into frontline health services across the UK, which he described as a "down payment" on a plan drawn up by NHS bosses calling for an extra £8bn a year above inflation by 2020. In England, everyone would be able to see a GP seven days a week by 2020. Recruit 5,000 more doctors.

https://www.conservatives.com/SecuringABetterFuture/GoodServices.aspx

Labour:
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would commit an extra £2.5bn a year above Mr Osborne's plan. The money will come from three sources - a new "mansion" tax, clamping down on tax avoidance by big corporations and a new tax on tobacco companies. Patients in England would get a GP appointment within 48 hours and would not have to wait longer than a week for cancer tests and results. Scrap the Health and Social Care Act and end "creeping privatisation" of the NHS. Integrate health and social care services into a system of "whole-person care". Give greater priority to mental health services. Replace the Cancer Drugs Fund in England when it runs out in 2016 with a £330m fund to improve access to innovative cancer drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. Recruit 5,000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes and introduce new safety checks to identify people at risk of hospitalisation. Prioritise child mental health by increasing the proportion of the mental health budget spent on children.
Commit extra £4.5bn to NHS. Ensure that patients get GP appointment within 48 hours. End "creeping privatisation" of the NHS. Integrate health and social services into "whole-person care".


Lib Dems: An extra £1bn for the NHS every year, to be funded by - amongst other things - making higher earners pay more tax on their shares. Half of this will go towards mental health. Ensure that spending on the NHS rises in line with growth in the economy. People who need therapy for conditions such as depression will be guaranteed treatment within 18 weeks. For young patients experiencing psychosis for the first time treatment will be provided within two weeks of being referred by a GP. This is all going to happen from April, with more mental health targets to follow if the Lib Dems return to government. Wants a cross-party review of the future of NHS funding.
Increase spending on NHS rises in line with growth of the economy, funded by increasing capital tax on high earners. Half of extra spending targeted at mental health. Ensure therapy is available within 18 weeks.

For Scottish NHS, increase yearly spending on NHS by more than inflation. Reduce number of senior managers by 25%. Streamline the work of health boards.

Plaid Cymru: Recruit 1,000 extra doctors to the Welsh NHS over two terms of a Plaid government. Offer financial incentives for recruiting doctors to areas and specialisms where there are, or are predicted to be, shortages. Encourage innovation and attract more research funding, in part by increasing research and development funding as government finance allows. Improve training for postgraduate doctors and stop them being used to "plug gaps" in staff rotas. More recruitment from within the EU to fill vacancies and using international doctors to staff the NHS while a new generation of Welsh doctors are trained.

UKIP: An extra £3bn per year in NHS funding paid for by quitting the EU and through "middle management" cuts. Keep NHS free at the point of delivery. Stop any further use of PFI, and encourage local authorities to buy out their PFI contracts early where it is affordable to do so. Ensure all visitors and migrants who have been here for fewer than five years have NHS-approved medical insurance as a condition of entry to UK, with £200m of the £2bn saved to be spent on ending hospital parking charges in England. Bring back state-enrolled nurses and return powers to matrons. Monitor and Care Quality Commission to be replaced with elected county health boards. Stop spending £90m a year on gastric band and breast enhancement operations.

Benefits and pensions:

Conservatives: No increase in benefits for working-age people for two years to save £3bn. Affects those receiving jobseekers' allowance, income support, tax credits and child benefit. Cut maximum amount a household can claim each year from £26,000 to £23,000. Withdraw Jobseeker's Allowance from young people after six months unless they take part in "community projects". And 18 to 21-year-olds wouldn't be entitled to housing benefit. Ban on zero-hours contracts which stop people getting work elsewhere. Raise the personal allowance - the point at which you start paying income tax - to £11,000 in April 2016 and then to £12,500 by 2020, which means that if you work on minimum wage for 30 hours you will pay no income tax.

Nick Clegg has said he would not accept Conservative plans to freeze working-age benefits without taxing the rich too. He hasn't said he would block welfare cuts altogether.
Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free TV Licence from pensioners on the 40% rate of income tax. A "yellow card" system to deal with benefit claimants breaking the rules, rather than imposing sanctions without warning.

Greens: The party backs a Citizen's Income, a fixed amount to be paid to every individual, whether they are in work or not, to be funded by higher taxes on the better off and green levies.

Abolish the work capability assessment and restore the level of the former disability living allowance. Scrap the government's welfare cap, which limits the maximum amount a household can claim annually to £26,000 a year.
